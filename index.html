                    <p>Team AC</p>
                    
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;①Junyi Zhang froms Team AC, student number is s3701407, student email is s3701407@student.rmit.edu.au. I was an overseas VCE student who can speak Chinese and English. Before coming to Australia, I played badminton pretty well. After experiencing the culture of Australia, I started to get in touch with skateboarding, because I often saw groups of skateboarders on the road, and the skateboarding culture slowly affected me. I also raised a very cute lop-eared rabbit and it is one year old.The richness and creativity of the IT industry has attracted me deeply. I can develop software that I can think of or design a web page that I am satisfied with, and so on. At the same time, the salary level in the IT industry is also considerable. After possessing a certain ability, as an IT staff, you can often get a good salary to support yourself and prove your value to the society.  My interest in IT started three years ago. I have a friend who understands IT much better than me, so I usually talk to him about this aspect. My interest in IT is a cumulative process.</p>
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;According to the online learning style test, I am a visual learner.
                        The result is:
                        As a visual learner, I can learn by reading or viewing pictures, and I can understand and remember things visually. I can imagine what I have learned in my mind and learn best by using mainly visual methods.
                        
                         In a team,I think working in real life can help me complete the team work in a down-to-earth manner. I prefer to put my energy into real life. It represents I will achieve victory in life in a way that does not attract attention. At the same time, I will save more energy and concentrate on my work. So I prefer a quiet and simple life. I prefer to be a contributor and follow the assigned tasks to complete with all my strength. At the same time, I will also learn the way of leader management team.</p>
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;②ZHEN YANG,a Chinese boy  from Team AC who is 20 years old now.This is my first semester of bachelor of information technology.Actually,I completed English training at REW from August to December last year.My nick name is Melo, probably some people are familiar with this name,that's because I used the name of one of my idols. He is a famous NBA star named Carmelo Anthony,people like to call him Melo. I am interested in almost all mainstream sports but most of them are just limited to watching games.Even if I don not participate in some sports in reality,however,the excitement of sports games still attract me deeply.So far I am more interested in security in IT. In fact, I do not know much about the IT field, but security is an absolutely indispensable part of the IT industry. Although the security in IT is complex and difficult like the encryption and decryption of various instructions, the principles are worthy of research. Honestly,so far I have no IT experience because I just study in university.Probably the only one experience is I have design a mini application as final exam when I studied in China's university.</p>

                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;in the big five personality Your personality traits interact to create unique patterns of thought and behavior. In this section, you'll learn how your traits work together to drive the way you interact with the world. To describe your personality patterns, we use a circular graph called a circumplex. The circumplex is used by psychologists to illustrate how two traits intersect to create more complex patterns of thought and behavior. Each circumplex has four sections, with each section describing a typical pattern. The area of each section shows how well that pattern describes you. A larger area indicates a better fit for that pattern. Some circumplex graphs will show a clear preference for one pattern. Others will show a more even spread over two or even three patterns. Where you have nearly equal scores for two or more patterns, you can expect that both patterns may describe you equally well. The results given by these two tests prove that I am a very sensitive person who can make very precise plans. In the team, I can act as the leader of the plan and assign the plan. I can quickly realize the problem of the plan. , It is of great help to the whole team, and I also have many shortcomings in the process of learning.

                    <p> Animals are an indispensable part of natural society, for humans, dogs are a special presence in daily life. As the most loyal partner of humans, dogs can always accurately capture the various signals released by humans. In order to get along better with the dog, overcoming the communication barriers between dogs and humans is a major issue worth breaking through. For this goal, our project aims to realize the communication between intelligent robots and dogs. By shaping the dog appearance of the robot and recording the sounds of different dogs, we can understand the dog's thoughts and learn more from their habits to get along better with them as much as possible. The key technology of this project is to analyze the frequencies and sizes of sounds produced by different dogs and explore the meaning of them.</p>
                    <p>According to Sundra Chelsea Atitwa(2018), there are more than 73 million dogs and over 42.5 million households have one or more dogs in United States. This is enough to prove that a number of people love dogs and treat them as one of their life partners. Dogs could not speak, but as friends, owners look forward to communicating with their dogs. The robot dog can receive dog language and convert it into human language, so that it can achieve barrier-free communication between dogs and humans. People can fully understand the dog's thoughts and give them better care is like having a close partner in real life.</p>
                    <p>For this product, its main body is an intelligent robot. The size of this robot can be various, just like there are many breeds of dogs. The appearance of the robot needs to be processed to look like a dog and their scent bags are to be put on because the dog has a sensitive sense of smell. These are to make the dog feel that they are the same as possible. What’s more, the sound device of this robot is indispensable. Dogs communicate by barking, the sounds of robot dogs should be similar to those of real dogs. Sometimes the barking sound of a dog is loud and takes a long time. The product needs to accurately accept and recognize the dog bark, because there may be various noises in life but the robot dog only needs to accept the dog bark. The most important point for this product is to deal with the language problems of humans and dogs. First of all, the robot dog will enter the languages of different countries and allow people to adjust them according to their preferences. For dog language, it is dog barking. The robot dog needs to record samples of dog barks of different sound sizes and lengths and sort out the corresponding meanings. Developers need to obtain the meaning of different dog barks as much as possible from professional researchers and professional dog owners. This robot dog will sort out the meaning of the dog bark it hears and convert it into the corresponding meaning of human language and then send it out through a sound device. For the words spoken by humans, the robot dog will use the same principle to convert the human speech it hears into the corresponding dog barking and send it out. The robot dog moves through wheels, but its moving speed will not be as fast as the dog because it sometimes causes the robot dog to roll over. When the robot dog hears the barking, it will determine the direction of the sound and move in that direction. Once it detects a dog in its sight, it will recognize the dog's breed and store the dog's information in the memory. For owners, they are allowed to enter information about their pet dog in the robot dog, including looks, name, age, etc. This product will use biometric technology to identify different dogs, just like fingerprint unlocking and facial unlocking of human mobile phones. The looks of many dogs make people unclear, especially dogs of the same breed. The use of biometric technology will avoid inaccurate photo identification. In addition, in order to better make the robot dog accepted by dogs, the appearance of this product can be made according to the needs of different families, organizations, or individuals. However, the problem in this project is the barking recognition technology. After all, humans were not dog, their languages are not the same. Lots of unknown problems may be encountered in language conversion, which may lead to inaccurate language conversion.</p>
                    <p>This project requires an intelligent robot as the main body, which must have basic motion functions. Some other auxiliary hardware devices need to be installed on the robot. First of all, the sound receiving and sending device is indispensable, it is used for communication. Second, there must be a camera system to identify different kinds of dogs. For software, a basic information system is required to store various voice information and dog information.  Moreover, an intelligent system that recognizes the meaning of sounds is the key to the entire robot. Finally, a biometric system is used to identify different kinds of dogs.</p>
                    <p>In order to complete this product, the function of realizing dog barking recognition and meaning conversion must be realized which need to be written. Moreover, the algorithm for visual tracking has to be written, which can be used to identify and track dogs. Developers also need to complete a basic system for storing dog information. The software for barking recognition and conversion is relatively difficult to implement. It needs to be combined with a sound device and finely sort out the differences between different barks. The meaning of barking is unknown, so it will face challenges to implement this algorithm.</p>
                    <p>If this project is successful, it will ideally achieve barrier-free communication between humans and dogs, which will make a huge change in human life. For people who like dogs, they will fully understand what dogs think and get along better with dogs like real friends. A number of dog attacks on humans will also be avoided in life, and lots of people will no longer have fear of dogs. For those social dog protection organizations, the number of stray dogs will drop drastically so they can spend more energy on other things. Dogs will play a different role in human life.</p>
